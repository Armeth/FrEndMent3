Just getting started on this one. Set things in place and will continue tomorrow.

Update 1: 
Got everything in place, probably finish it tomorrow. Learned more about flexbox and best ways of centering the card. Also generaly better ways of organizing the html. 

Final: 
This was a fun one and I learned about @media specifications as well as that you can have a srcset and other things. The only thing I couldn't seem to get done was centering the cart svg icon in relation to the text "Add to Cart".
